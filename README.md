# 👋 Hi, I’m Dang Khoa Nguyen
Welcome to my Github profile! I'm a Software Engineering at Adelaide University passionate about creating web applications that solve real-world problems and exploring the world of machine learning. My journey began with learning Python and HTML/CSS, which helped me build strong logic and turn creative ideas into functional, real-life applications through code.

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- **Languages & Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Python (flask), JavaScript, Java, C# (.NET), TypeScript
- **Databases & Backend**: MySQL, Supabase
- **AI / ML**: Google GenAI

## 🌱 Projects
1. PawPals – A web application designed to help users find lost pets and reconnect them with their owners.
2. MyFinFriend – A personal finance management website developed in collaboration with Huy Hoang Phi, aimed at helping users better manage their finances.
3. GroceryScout (considered to build in the future) – A web application that suggests stores offering lower prices for specific items, helping users make smarter purchasing decisions.

## 🚀 Exploration
I’m currently deepening my skills in Next.js and TypeScript to build scalable web applications, while also improving my UI/UX design skills using Figma. In addition, I’m expanding my knowledge of backend and cloud technologies, including AWS and MongoDB.
